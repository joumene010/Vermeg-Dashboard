# 🔬 Vermeg Project – AI-Driven Web Development Research  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project was conducted as part of research at **Vermeg** to explore the capabilities of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** in web application development. The goal was to evaluate different **prompt engineering techniques** using **ChatGPT-4** and **GitHub Copilot** to determine the most efficient methods for AI-assisted development.  

### 🏗 Web Application Details  
- **Backend**: Spring Boot  
- **Frontend**: Angular  
- **Functionality**:  
  - Manages **jurisdiction data** in a structured table  
  - Supports full **CRUD operations**  
  - Secure and scalable architecture  

### 🔍 Research Focus  
- Testing **AI-driven development** techniques  
- Comparing **ChatGPT-4** and **GitHub Copilot** for code generation  
- Identifying the most **efficient prompt engineering strategies**  

## 📂 What's in This Repository?  
- **Source Code**: The complete backend (Spring Boot) and frontend (Angular) implementation  
- **Research Report**: Findings and conclusions from the study  

## 🚀 Key Insights  
✅ AI-assisted development accelerates web application creation  
✅ Effective **prompt engineering** improves code quality & efficiency  
✅ LLMs can significantly support **full-stack development**  

Feel free to explore the code and report for further insights! 🚀
